  abstract = {Heterogeneity in the genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer has become apparent through several comprehensive profiling efforts, but little is known about the impact of this heterogeneity on clinical outcome. Here, we report comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 429 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) linked with longitudinal clinical outcomes, integrating findings from whole-exome, transcriptome, and histologic analysis. For 128 patients treated with a first-line next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI; abiraterone or enzalutamide), we examined the association of 18 recurrent DNA- and RNA-based genomic alterations, including androgen receptor (               AR               ) variant expression, AR transcriptional output, and neuroendocrine expression signatures, with clinical outcomes. Of these, only               RB1               alteration was significantly associated with poor survival, whereas alterations in               RB1               ,               AR               , and               TP53               were associated with shorter time on treatment with an ARSI. This large analysis integrating mCRPC genomics with histology and clinical outcomes identifies               RB1               genomic alteration as a potent predictor of poor outcome, and is a community resource for further interrogation of clinical and molecular associations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other members of the homologous recombination pathway have potential therapeutic relevance when used to support agents that introduce or exploit double-stranded DNA breaks. This study examines the association between homologous recombination defects and genomic patterns of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). METHODS: Ovarian tumours from two independent data sets were characterised for defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51C, and LOH profiles were generated. Publically available data were downloaded for a third independent data set. The same analyses were performed on 57 cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Loss of heterozygosity regions of intermediate size were observed more frequently in tumours with defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 (P ¼ 10 À 11). The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score was defined as the number of these regions observed in a tumour sample. The association between HRD score and BRCA deficiency was validated in two independent ovarian cancer data sets (P ¼ 10 À 5 and 10 À 29), and identified breast and pancreatic cell lines with BRCA defects. CONCLUSION: The HRD score appears capable of detecting homologous recombination defects regardless of aetiology or mechanism. This score could facilitate the use of PARP inhibitors and platinum in breast, ovarian, and other cancers.

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} Genetic variations of some driver genes in non-­small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had shown potential impact on immune microenvironment and associated with response or resistance to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade immunotherapy. We therefore undertook an exploratory analysis to develop a genomic mutation signature (GMS) and predict the response to anti-­PD-­(L)1 therapy. Methods\hspace{0.6em} In this multicohort analysis, 316 patients with non-­squamous NSCLC treated with anti-P­ D-­(L)1 from three independent cohorts were included in our study. Tumor samples from the patients were molecularly profiled by MSK-­IMPACT or whole exome sequencing. We developed a risk model named GMS based on the MSK training cohort (n=123). The predictive model was first validated in the separate internal MSK cohort (n=82) and then validated in an external cohort containing 111 patients from previously published clinical trials. Results\hspace{0.6em} A GMS risk model consisting of eight genes (TP53, KRAS, STK11, EGFR, PTPRD, KMT2C, SMAD4, and HGF) was generated to classify patients into high and low GMS groups in the training cohort. Patients with high GMS in the training cohort had longer progression-­free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 0.28–0.61, p{$<$}0.0001) and overall survival (HR 0.53, 0.32–0.89, p=0.0275) compared with low GMS. We noted equivalent findings in the internal validation cohort and in the external validation cohort. The GMS was demonstrated as an independent predictive factor for anti-­PD-­(L)1 therapy comparing with tumor mutational burden. Meanwhile, GMS showed undifferentiated predictive value in patients with different clinicopathological features. Notably, both GMS and PD-­L1 were independent predictors and demonstrated poorly correlated; inclusion of PD-­L1 with GMS further improved the predictive capacity for PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Our study highlights the potential predictive value of GMS for immunotherapeutic benefit in non-­squamous NSCLC. Besides, the combination of GMS and PD-­L1 may serve as an optimal partner in guiding treatment decisions for anti-­PD-­(L)1 based therapy.},

  abstract = {Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for precision oncology. Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequenceand structure-based analyses identified {$>$}3,400 putative missense driver mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation confirmed 60\%–85\% of predicted mutations as likely drivers.

Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types.

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Performing a statistical test requires a null hypothesis. In cancer genomics, a key challenge is the fast generation of accurate somatic mutational landscapes that can be used as a realistic null hypothesis for making biological discoveries. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Here we present SigProfilerSimulator, a powerful tool that is capable of simulating the mutational landscapes of thousands of cancer genomes at different resolutions within seconds. Applying SigProfilerSimulator to 2144 whole-genome sequenced cancers reveals: (i) that most doublet base substitutions are not due to two adjacent single base substitutions but likely occur as single genomic events; (ii) that an extended sequencing context of ±\,2 bp is required to more completely capture the patterns of substitution mutational signatures in human cancer; (iii) information on false-positive discovery rate of commonly used bioinformatics tools for detecting driver genes. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} SigProfilerSimulator’s breadth of features allows one to construct a tailored null hypothesis and use it for evaluating the accuracy of other bioinformatics tools or for downstream statistical analysis for biological discoveries.

@article{bergstromSigProfilerMatrixGeneratorToolVisualizing2019,
  title = {{{SigProfilerMatrixGenerator}}: A Tool for Visualizing and Exploring Patterns of Small Mutational Events},
  author = {Bergstrom, Erik N},
  date = {2019},
  pages = {12},
  abstract = {Background: Cancer genomes are peppered with somatic mutations imprinted by different mutational processes. The mutational pattern of a cancer genome can be used to identify and understand the etiology of the underlying mutational processes. A plethora of prior research has focused on examining mutational signatures and mutational patterns from single base substitutions and their immediate sequencing context. We recently demonstrated that further classification of small mutational events (including substitutions, insertions, deletions, and doublet substitutions) can be used to provide a deeper understanding of the mutational processes that have molded a cancer genome. However, there has been no standard tool that allows fast, accurate, and comprehensive classification for all types of small mutational events. Results: Here, we present SigProfilerMatrixGenerator, a computational tool designed for optimized exploration and visualization of mutational patterns for all types of small mutational events. SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is written in Python with an R wrapper package provided for users that prefer working in an R environment. SigProfilerMatrixGenerator produces fourteen distinct matrices by considering transcriptional strand bias of individual events and by incorporating distinct classifications for single base substitutions, doublet base substitutions, and small insertions and deletions. While the tool provides a comprehensive classification of mutations, SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is also faster and more memory efficient than existing tools that generate only a single matrix. Conclusions: SigProfilerMatrixGenerator provides a standardized method for classifying small mutational events that is both efficient and scalable to large datasets. In addition to extending the classification of single base substitutions, the tool is the first to provide support for classifying doublet base substitutions and small insertions and deletions. SigProfilerMatrixGenerator is freely available at https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/ SigProfilerMatrixGenerator with an extensive documentation at https://osf.io/s93d5/wiki/home/.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The identification of the mutational processes operating in tumour cells has implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy. These processes leave mutational patterns on the cancer genomes, which are referred to as mutational signatures. Recently, 81 mutational signatures have been inferred using computational algorithms on sequencing data of 23,879 samples. However, these published signatures may not always offer a comprehensive view on the biological processes underlying tumour types that are not included or underrepresented in the reference studies. To circumvent this problem, we designed               CaMuS               (Cancer Mutational Signatures) to construct de novo signatures while simultaneously fitting publicly available mutational signatures. Furthermore, we propose to estimate signature similarity by comparing probability distributions using the Hellinger distance. We applied               CaMuS               to infer signatures of mutational processes in poorly studied cancer types. We used whole genome sequencing data of 56 neuroblastoma, thus providing evidence for the versatility of               CaMuS               . Using simulated data, we compared the performance of               CaMuS               to               sigfit               , a recently developed algorithm with comparable inference functionalities.               CaMuS               and               sigfit               reconstructed the simulated datasets with similar accuracy; however two main features may argue for               CaMuS               over               sigfit               : (i) superior computational performance and (ii) a reliable parameter selection method to avoid spurious signatures.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade represents a major breakthrough in cancer therapy; however, responses are not universal. Genomic and immune features in pretreatment tumor biopsies have been reported to correlate with response in patients with melanoma and other cancers, but robust biomarkers have not been identified. We studied a cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma initially treated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) blockade (n = 53) followed by programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade at progression (n = 46), and analyzed immune signatures in longitudinal tissue samples collected at multiple time points during therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that adaptive immune signatures in tumor biopsy samples obtained early during the course of treatment are highly predictive of response to immune checkpoint blockade and also demonstrate differential effects on the tumor microenvironment induced by CTLA4 and PD-1 blockade. Importantly, potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade were also identified.},

  abstract = {The role of enhancers, a key class of non-coding regulatory DNA elements, in cancer development has increasingly been appreciated. Here, we present the detection and characterization of a large number of expressed enhancers in a genome-wide analysis of 8928 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using TCGA RNA-seq data. Compared with matched normal tissues, global enhancer activation was observed in most cancers. Across cancer types, global enhancer activity was positively associated with aneuploidy, but not mutation load, suggesting a hypothesis centered on ‘‘chromatin-state’’ to explain their interplay. Integrating eQTL, mRNA coexpression, and Hi-C data analysis, we developed a computational method to infer causal enhancergene interactions, revealing enhancers of clinically actionable genes. Having identified an enhancer \$140 kb downstream of PD-L1, a major immunotherapy target, we validated it experimentally. This study provides a systematic view of enhancer activity in diverse tumor contexts and suggests the clinical implications of enhancers.},

  abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are commonly dysregulated in tumors, but only a handful are known to play pathophysiological roles in cancer. We inferred lncRNAs that dysregulate cancer pathways, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors (cancer genes) by modeling their effects on the activity of transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and microRNAs in 5,185 TCGA tumors and 1,019 ENCODE assays. Our predictions included hundreds of candidate onco- and tumor-suppressor lncRNAs (cancer lncRNAs) whose somatic alterations account for the dysregulation of dozens of cancer genes and pathways in each of 14 tumor contexts. To demonstrate proof of concept, we showed that perturbations targeting OIP5-AS1 (an inferred tumor suppressor) and TUG1 and WT1-AS (inferred onco-lncRNAs) dysregulated cancer genes and altered proliferation of breast and gynecologic cancer cells. Our analysis indicates that, although most lncRNAs are dysregulated in a tumor-specific manner, some, including OIP5-AS1, TUG1, NEAT1, MEG3, and TSIX, synergistically dysregulate cancer pathways in multiple tumor contexts.},

Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.},

We report the evaluation of {$>$}300 patient samples across 22 tumor types from four KEYNOTE clinical trials. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a T cell–inflamed gene expression profile (GEP) exhibited joint predictive utility in identifying responders and nonresponders to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. TMB and GEP were independently predictive of response and demonstrated low correlation, suggesting that they capture distinct features of neoantigenicity and T cell activation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed TMB and GEP to have a low correlation, and analysis by joint stratification revealed biomarker-defined patterns of targetable-resistance biology. These biomarkers may have utility in clinical trial design by guiding rational selection of anti–PD-1 monotherapy and combination immunotherapy regimens.},

  abstract = {Background: Assays of the abundance of immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment promise to inform immune oncology research and the choice of immunotherapy for individual patients. We propose to measure the intratumoral abundance of various immune cell populations with gene expression. In contrast to IHC and flow cytometry, gene expression assays yield high information content from a clinically practical workflow. Previous studies of gene expression in purified immune cells have reported hundreds of genes showing enrichment in a single cell type, but the utility of these genes in tumor samples is unknown. We use co-expression patterns in large tumor gene expression datasets to evaluate previously reported candidate cell type marker genes lists, eliminate numerous false positives and identify a subset of high confidence marker genes. Methods: Using a novel statistical tool, we use co-expression patterns in 9986 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate previously reported cell type marker genes. We compare immune cell scores derived from these genes to measurements from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We characterize the reproducibility of our cell scores in replicate runs of RNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue. Results: We identify a list of 60 marker genes whose expression levels measure 14 immune cell populations. Cell type scores calculated from these genes are concordant with flow cytometry and IHC readings, show high reproducibility in replicate RNA samples from FFPE tissue and enable detailed analyses of the anti-tumor immune response in TCGA. In an immunotherapy dataset, they separate responders and non-responders early on therapy and provide an intricate picture of the effects of checkpoint inhibition. Most genes previously reported to be enriched in a single cell type have co-expression patterns inconsistent with cell type specificity. Conclusions: Due to their concise gene set, computational simplicity and utility in tumor samples, these cell type gene signatures may be useful in future discovery research and clinical trials to understand how tumors and therapeutic intervention shape the immune response.},

  abstract = {The Tumor Inflammation Signature (TIS) is an investigational use only (IUO) 18-gene signature that measures a pre-existing but suppressed adaptive immune response within tumors. The TIS has been shown to enrich for patients who respond to the anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab. To explore this immune phenotype within and across tumor types, we applied the TIS algorithm to over 9000 tumor gene expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As expected based on prior evidence, tumors with known clinical sensitivity to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade had higher average TIS scores. Furthermore, TIS scores were more variable within than between tumor types, and within each tumor type a subset of patients with elevated scores was identifiable although with different prevalence associated with each tumor type, the latter consistent with the observed clinical responsiveness to anti PD-1 blockade. Notably, TIS scores only minimally correlated with mutation load in most tumors and ranking tumors by median TIS score showed differing association to clinical sensitivity to PD-1/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade than ranking of the same tumors by mutation load. The expression patterns of the TIS algorithm genes were conserved across tumor types yet appeared to be minimally prognostic in most cancers, consistent with the TIS score serving as a pan-cancer measurement of the inflamed tumor phenotype. Characterization of the prevalence and variability of TIS will lead to increased understanding of the immune status of untreated tumors and may lead to improved indication selection for testing immunotherapy agents.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        The standardization, portability, and reproducibility of analysis pipelines is a renowned problem within the bioinformatics community. Most pipelines are designed for execution on-premise, and the associated software dependencies are tightly coupled with the local compute environment. This leads to poor pipeline portability and reproducibility of the ensuing results - both of which are fundamental requirements for the validation of scientific findings. Here, we introduce             nf-core             : a framework that provides a community-driven, peer-reviewed platform for the development of best practice analysis pipelines written in Nextflow. Key obstacles in pipeline development such as portability, reproducibility, scalability and unified parallelism are inherently addressed by all             nf-core             pipelines. We are also continually developing a suite of tools that assist in the creation and development of both new and existing pipelines. Our primary goal is to provide a platform for high-quality, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines that can be utilized across various institutions and research facilities.},

Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a workhorse for signal and data analytics, triggered by its model parsimony and interpretability. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining and hyperspectral imaging---had been rather limited until recent years. Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF, thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable factorization tools for their own problems.},

  abstract = {Background: RNA-seq is widely used for transcriptomic profiling, but the bioinformatics analysis of resultant data can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for biologists. We aim to streamline the bioinformatic analyses of gene-level data by developing a user-friendly, interactive web application for exploratory data analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis. Results: iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) seamlessly connects 63 R/Bioconductor packages, 2 web services, and comprehensive annotation and pathway databases for 220 plant and animal species. The workflow can be reproduced by downloading customized R code and related pathway files. As an example, we analyzed an RNA-Seq dataset of lung fibroblasts with Hoxa1 knockdown and revealed the possible roles of SP1 and E2F1 and their target genes, including microRNAs, in blocking G1/S transition. In another example, our analysis shows that in mouse B cells without functional p53, ionizing radiation activates the MYC pathway and its downstream genes involved in cell proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and non-coding RNA metabolism. In wildtype B cells, radiation induces p53-mediated apoptosis and DNA repair while suppressing the target genes of MYC and E2F1, and leads to growth and cell cycle arrest. iDEP helps unveil the multifaceted functions of p53 and the possible involvement of several microRNAs such as miR-92a, miR-504, and miR-30a. In both examples, we validated known molecular pathways and generated novel, testable hypotheses. Conclusions: Combining comprehensive analytic functionalities with massive annotation databases, iDEP (http://ge-lab.org/idep/) enables biologists to easily translate transcriptomic and proteomic data into actionable insights.},

  abstract = {Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process of adding single ubiquitin molecules or various ubiquitin chains to target proteins. Here, using multidimensional omic data of 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we perform comprehensive molecular characterization of 929 ubiquitin-related genes and 95 deubiquitinase genes. Among them, we systematically identify top somatic driver candidates, including mutated FBXW7 with cancer-type-specific patterns and amplified MDM2 showing a mutually exclusive pattern with BRAF mutations. Ubiquitin pathway genes tend to be upregulated in cancer mediated by diverse mechanisms. By integrating pan-cancer multiomic data, we identify a group of tumor samples that exhibit worse prognosis. These samples are consistently associated with the upregulation of cell-cycle and DNA repair pathways, characterized by mutated TP53, MYC/TERT amplification, and APC/PTEN deletion. Our analysis highlights the importance of the ubiquitin pathway in cancer development and lays a foundation for developing relevant therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Identifying the earliest somatic changes in prostate cancer can give important insights into tumor evolution and aids in stratifying high- from low-risk disease. We integrated whole genome, transcriptome and methylome analysis of early-onset prostate cancers (diagnosis \%55 years). Characterization across 292 prostate cancer genomes revealed age-related genomic alterations and a clock-like enzymatic-driven mutational process contributing to the earliest mutations in prostate cancer patients. Our integrative analysis identified four molecular subgroups, including a particularly aggressive subgroup with recurrent duplications associated with increased expression of ESRP1, which we validate in 12,000 tissue microarray tumors. Finally, we combined the patterns of molecular co-occurrence and risk-based subgroup information to deconvolve the molecular and clinical trajectories of prostate cancer from single patient samples.},

Yet, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit. It is thus critical to understand the determinants driving response, resistance and adverse effects. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss recent work demonstrating that immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy is affected by a combination of factors involving tumour genomics, host germline genetics, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) levels and other features of the tumour microenvironment, as well as the gut microbiome. We focus on recently identified molecular and cellular determinants of response. A better understanding of how these variables cooperate to affect tumour–host interactions is needed to optimize the implementation of precision immunotherapy.},

Each process leaves a characteristic imprint — a mutational signature — on the cancer genome, which is defined by the type of DNA damage and DNA repair processes that result in base substitutions, insertions and deletions or structural variations. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing, researchers are identifying an increasing array of these signatures. Mutational signatures can be used as a physiological readout of the biological history of a cancer and also have potential use for discerning ongoing mutational processes from historical ones, thus possibly revealing new targets for anticancer therapies.},

Here we identified a novel GGCT-regulated glutathione (GSH)-reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathway in oncogenic stress alleviation. We identified GGCT as a target of oncogenic Ras and that it is required for oncogenic Ras-induced primary mouse cell proliferation and transformation and in vivo lung cancer formation in the LSL-Kras G12D mouse model. However, GGCT deficiency is compatible with normal mouse development, suggesting that GGCT can be a cancer-specific therapeutic target. Genetically amplified GGCT locus further supports the oncogenic driving function of GGCT. In summary, our study not only identifies an oncogenic function of GGCT but also identifies a novel regulator of GSH metabolism, with implications for further understanding of oncogenic stress and cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: To identify clinically relevant genomic rearrangement signatures in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), we conducted a retrospective analysis of sequenced HGSOC whole-tumor genomes. Methods: Clinical data and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads were obtained for primary HGSOC tumors sequenced by the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS; n ¼ 80). Genomic rearrangements were identified, and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to extract rearrangement signatures. The cohort was then dichotomized around the median signature contribution, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. An independent cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer study (n ¼ 490) was also examined. The TCGA cohort was dichotomized around the median similarity between tumor copy number profile and a prognostic rearrangement signature, and OS was analyzed. Outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression methods. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified five genomic rearrangement signatures (Ov.RS1-5) in HGSOC. Ov.RS3 exhibited 10 kilobase to 10 megabase deletions and tandem duplications, and patients whose tumors exhibited a high contribution from Ov.RS3 had poor OS. The median OS was 22.7 months (95\% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 20.2 to 39.0 months) in the Ov.RS3-high group vs 38.2 months (95\% CI ¼ 22.7 to 69.1 months) in the Ov.RS3-low group (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 1.86, 95\% CI ¼ 1.12 to 3.09, P ¼ .02). For the independent TCGA cohort, median OS rates were 38.0 months (95\% CI ¼ 35.3 to 41.4 months) in the Ov.RS3 highsimilarity group vs 48.9 months (95\% CI ¼ 44.1 to 57.1 months) in the Ov.RS3 low-similarity group (HR ¼ 1.54, 95\% CI ¼ 1.21 to 1.97, P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: A novel genomic rearrangement signature is associated with poor prognosis in HGSOC. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a lethal malignancy that is diagnosed in approximately 22 000 women per year in the United States (1). Initial treatment of advanced HGSOC involves a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Molecularly targeted therapies such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are now being used in the treatment of recurrent disease (2). Of these targeted therapies, PARP inhibitors act in synergy with homologous recombination repair pathway deficiency (HRD), a genomic instability phenotype exhibited by a subset of HGSOC (3).},

  abstract = {Motivation: Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome’s mutation catalog into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a patient’s mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of such decomposition.},

  abstract = {Although not all somatic mutations are cancer drivers, their mutational signatures, i.e. the patterns of genomic alterations at a genome-wide scale, provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, DNA damage and repair processes. Computational deconvolution of somatic mutation patterns and expert curation pan-cancer studies have identified a number of mutational signatures associated with point mutations, dinucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions, and rearrangements, and have established etiologies for a subset of these signatures. However, the mechanisms underlying nearly one-third of all mutational signatures are not yet understood. The signatures with established etiology and those with hitherto unknown origin appear to have some differences in strand bias, GC content and nucleotide context diversity. It is possible that some of the hitherto ‘unknown’ signatures predominantly occur outside gene regions. While nucleotide contexts might be adequate to establish etiologies of some mutational signatures, in other cases additional features, such as broader (epi)genomic contexts, including chromatin, replication timing, processivity and local mutational patterns, may help fully understand the underlying DNA damage and repair processes. Nonetheless, remarkable progress in characterization of mutational signatures has provided fundamental insights into the biology of cancer, informed disease etiology and opened up new opportunities for cancer prevention, risk management, and therapeutic decision making.},

Despite a clear rationale for such vaccines, extensive past efforts were unsuccessful in mediating clinically relevant antitumour activity in humans. Recently, however, next-generation sequencing and novel bioinformatics tools have enabled the systematic discovery of tumour neoantigens, which are highly desirable immunogens because they arise from somatic mutations of the tumour and are therefore tumour specific. As a result of the diversity of tumour neoepitopes between individuals, the development of personalized cancer vaccines is warranted.

  abstract = {Studies of cancer mutations typically focus on identifying cancer driving mutations. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of passenger somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as mutations triggered by carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. Understanding the etiology of the mutational signatures shaping a cancer genome is an important step towards understanding tumorigenesis. Considering mutational signatures as phenotypes, we asked two complementary questions (i) what are functional pathways whose gene expression profiles are associated with mutational signatures, and (ii) what are mutated pathways (if any) that might underlie specific mutational signatures? We have been able to identify pathways associated with mutational signatures on both expression and mutation levels. In particular, our analysis provides novel insights into mutagenic processes in breast cancer by capturing important differences in the etiology of different APOBEC related signatures and the two clock-like signatures. These results are important for understanding mutagenic processes in cancer and for developing personalized drug therapies.},

  abstract = {Lack of a general matrix formula hampers implementation of the semi-partial correlation, also known as part correlation, to the higher-order coefficient. This is because the higher-order semipartial correlation calculation using a recursive formula requires an enormous number of recursive calculations to obtain the correlation coefficients. To resolve this difficulty, we derive a general matrix formula of the semi-partial correlation for fast computation. The semi-partial correlations are then implemented on an R package ppcor along with the partial correlation. Owing to the general matrix formulas, users can readily calculate the coefficients of both partial and semipartial correlations without computational burden. The package ppcor further provides users with the level of the statistical significance with its test statistic.},

Currently, experimental efforts aimed at validating and understanding the etiologies of cancer-derived mutational signatures are underway. In this review, we highlight key aspects of mutational signature experimental design and describe the analytical framework. We suggest guidelines and quality control measures for handling whole-genome sequencing data for mutational signature analyses and discuss pitfalls in interpretation. We envision that improved next-generation sequencing technologies and molecular cell biology approaches will usher in the next generation of studies into the etiologies and mechanisms of mutational patterns uncovered in cancers.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Cancer is the result of mutagenic processes that can be inferred from tumor genomes by analyzing rate spectra of point mutations, or “mutational signatures”. Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates DNA replication error as a background, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of 147 tumors from pancreatic cancer, discovering 8 signatures in addition to the background.},

  abstract = {For de novo mutational signature analysis, the critical first step is to decide how many signatures should be expected in a cancer genomics study. An incorrect number could mislead downstream analyses. Here we present SUITOR (selecting the number of mutational signatures through cross-validation), an unsupervised cross-validation method that requires little assumptions and no numerical approximations to select the optimal number of signatures without overfitting the data. In vitro studies and in silico simulations demonstrated that SUITOR can correctly identify signatures, some of which were missed by other widely used methods. Applied to 1,536 whole-genome sequenced tumors across eight cancer types, SUITOR selected signatures with the smallest prediction errors and almost all signatures of breast cancer selected by SUITOR were validated in an independent study. SUITOR is a powerful tool to select the optimal number of mutational signatures, facilitating downstream analyses with etiological or therapeutic importance.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding the interactions between tumor and the host immune system is critical to finding prognostic biomarkers, reducing drug resistance, and developing new therapies. Novel computational methods are needed to estimate tumor-infiltrating immune cells and understand tumor–immune interactions in cancers. Results: We analyze tumor-infiltrating immune cells in over 10,000 RNA-seq samples across 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our computationally inferred immune infiltrates associate much more strongly with patient clinical features, viral infection status, and cancer genetic alterations than other computational approaches. Analysis of cancer/testis antigen expression and CD8 T-cell abundance suggests that MAGEA3 is a potential immune target in melanoma, but not in non-small cell lung cancer, and implicates SPAG5 as an alternative cancer vaccine target in multiple cancers. We find that melanomas expressing high levels of CTLA4 separate into two distinct groups with respect to CD8 T-cell infiltration, which might influence clinical responses to anti-CTLA4 agents. We observe similar dichotomy of TIM3 expression with respect to CD8 T cells in kidney cancer and validate it experimentally. The abundance of immune infiltration, together with our downstream analyses and findings, are accessible through TIMER, a public resource at http://cistrome.org/TIMER. Conclusions: We develop a computational approach to study tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with cancer cells. Our resource of immune-infiltrate levels, clinical associations, as well as predicted therapeutic markers may inform effective cancer vaccine and checkpoint blockade therapies.},

  abstract = {For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program collected clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types. TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale.},

Probabilistic and statistical modeling played a pivotal role in the discovery of general patterns from cancer genomics datasets and continue to be of central importance for personalized medicine. Results: In this review we introduce cancer genomics from a probabilistic and statistical perspective. We start from (1) functional classification of genes into oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, then (2) demonstrate the importance of comprehensive analysis of different mutation types for individual cancer genomes, followed by (3) tumor purity analysis, which in turn leads to (4) the concept of ploidy and clonality, that is next connected to (5) tumor evolution under treatment pressure, which yields insights into cancer drug resistance. We also discuss future challenges including the non-coding genomic regions, integrative analysis of genomics and epigenomics, as well as early cancer detection. Conclusion: We believe probabilistic and statistical modeling will continue to play important roles for novel discoveries in the field of cancer genomics and personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death–1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational load to better profile responses to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal in cancer research is to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation. This is key to developing more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches. One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the 1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily. Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the Integrative OncoGenomics (IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000 tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer.},

The combination of six MHC-I alleles each individual carries defines the sub-peptidome that can be effectively presented. We applied this concept to human cancer, hypothesizing that oncogenic mutations could arise in gaps in personal MHC-I presentation. To validate this hypothesis, we developed and applied a residuecentric patient presentation score to 9,176 cancer patients across 1,018 recurrent oncogenic mutations. We found that patient MHC-I genotype-based scores could predict which mutations were more likely to emerge in their tumor. Accordingly, poor presentation of a mutation across patients was correlated with higher frequency among tumors. These results support that MHC-I genotype-restricted immunoediting during tumor formation shapes the landscape of oncogenic mutations observed in clinically diagnosed tumors and paves the way for predicting personal cancer susceptibilities from knowledge of MHC-I genotype.},

MHC-II-restricted CD4+ T cells also drive anti-tumor responses, but their relation to neoantigen selection and tumor evolution has not been systematically studied. Modeling the potential of an individual’s MHC-II genotype to present 1,018 driver mutations in 5,942 tumors, we demonstrate that the MHC-II genotype constrains the mutational landscape during tumorigenesis in a manner complementary to MHC-I. Mutations poorly bound to MHC-II are positively selected during tumorigenesis, even more than mutations poorly bound to MHC-I. This emphasizes the importance of CD4+ T cells in anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we observed less inter-patient variation in mutation presentation for MHC-II than for MHC-I. These differences were reflected by age at diagnosis, which was correlated with presentation by MHC-I only. Collectively, our results emphasize the central role of MHC-II presentation in tumor evolution.},

  abstract = {Mutation signatures are defined as the distribution of specific mutations such as activity of AID/APOBEC family proteins. Previous studies have reported numerous signatures, using matrix factorization methods for mutation catalogs. Different mutation signatures are active in different tumor types; hence, signature activity varies greatly among tumor types and becomes sparse. Because of this, many previous methods require dividing mutation catalogs for each tumor type. Here, we propose parallelized latent Dirichlet allocation (PLDA), a novel Bayesian model to simultaneously predict mutation signatures with all mutation catalogs. PLDA is an extended model of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is one of the methods used for signature prediction. It has parallelized hyperparameters of Dirichlet distributions for LDA, and they represent the sparsity of signature activities for each tumor type, thus facilitating simultaneous analyses. First, we conducted a simulation experiment to compare PLDA with previous methods (including SigProfiler and SignatureAnalyzer) using artificial data and confirmed that PLDA could predict signature structures as accurately as previous methods without searching for the optimal hyperparameters. Next, we applied PLDA to PCAWG (Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) mutation catalogs and obtained a signature set different from the one predicted by SigProfiler. Further, we have shown that the mutation spectrum represented by the predicted signature with PLDA provides a novel interpretability through post-analyses.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing studies have revealed genome-wide structural variation patterns in cancer, such as chromothripsis and chromoplexy, that do not engage a single discernable driver mutation, and whose clinical relevance is unclear. We devised a robust genomic metric able to identify cancers with a chromotype called tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) characterized by frequent and distributed tandem duplications (TDs). Enriched only in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in ovarian, endometrial, and liver cancers, TDP tumors conjointly exhibit tumor protein p53 (               TP53               ) mutations, disruption of breast cancer 1 (               BRCA1               ), and increased expression of DNA replication genes pointing at rereplication in a defective checkpoint environment as a plausible causal mechanism. The resultant TDs in TDP augment global oncogene expression and disrupt tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, the TDP strongly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in both TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts. We conclude that the TDP is a common cancer chromotype that coordinately alters oncogene/tumor suppressor expression with potential as a marker for chemotherapeutic response.},

  abstract = {APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are largely known for their innate immune protection from viral infections. Recently, members of the family have been associated with a distinct mutational activity in some cancer types. We report a pan-tissue, pan-cancer analysis of RNA-seq data specific to the APOBEC3 genes in 8,951 tumours, 786 cancer cell lines and 6,119 normal tissues. By deconvolution of levels of different cell types in tumour admixtures, we demonstrate that APOBEC3B (A3B), the primary candidate as a cancer mutagen, shows little association with immune cell types compared to its paralogues. We present a pipeline called RESPECTEx (REconstituting SPecific Cell-Type Expression) and use it to deconvolute cell-type specific expression levels in a given cohort of tumour samples. We functionally annotate APOBEC3 co-expressing genes, and create an interactive visualization tool which ‘barcodes’ the functional enrichment (http://fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ apobec-barcodes/). These analyses reveal that A3B expression correlates with cell cycle and DNA repair genes, whereas the other APOBEC3 members display specificity for immune processes and immune cell populations. We offer molecular insights into the functions of individual APOBEC3 proteins in antiviral and proliferative contexts, and demonstrate the diversification this family of enzymes displays at the transcriptomic level, despite their high similarity in protein sequences and structures.},

  abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is characterized by genomic instability, ubiquitous TP53 loss, and frequent development of platinum resistance. Loss of homologous recombination (HR) is a mutator phenotype present in 50\% of HGSOCs and confers hypersensitivity to platinum treatment. We asked which other mutator phenotypes are present in HGSOC and how they drive the emergence of platinum resistance. We performed whole-genome paired-end sequencing on a model of two HGSOC cases, each consisting of a pair of cell lines established before and after clinical resistance emerged, to describe their structural variants (SVs) and to infer their ancestral genomes as the SVs present within each pair. The first case (PEO1/PEO4), with HR deficiency, acquired translocations and small deletions through its early evolution, but a revertant BRCA2 mutation restoring HR function in the resistant lineage re-stabilized its genome and reduced platinum sensitivity. The second case (PEO14/PEO23) had 216 tandem duplications and did not show evidence of HR or mismatch repair deficiency. By comparing the cell lines to the tissues from which they originated, we showed that the tandem duplicator mutator phenotype arose early in progression in vivo and persisted throughout evolution in vivo and in vitro, which may have enabled continual evolution. From the analysis of SNP array data from 454 HGSOC cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas series, we estimate that 12.8\% of cases show patterns of aberrations similar to the tandem duplicator, and this phenotype is mutually exclusive with BRCA1/2 carrier mutations.},

  abstract = {Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) results in impaired double strand break repair and is a frequent driver of tumorigenesis. Here, we used a machine learning approach to develop a sensitive pan-cancer Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency (CHORD). CHORD employs genomewide genomic footprints of somatic mutations characteristic for HRD and that discriminates BRCA1and BRCA2-subtypes. Analysis of a metastatic pan-cancer cohort of 3,504 patients revealed HRD to occur at a frequency of 6\% with highest rates for ovarian cancer (30\%), comparable frequencies for breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer (12-13\%) and incidental cases in other cancer types. Ovarian and breast cancer were equally driven by BRCA1- and BRCA2-type HRD, whereas for prostate, pancreatic and urinary tract cancers BRCA2-type HRD was predominant. Biallelic inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C and PALB2 were found as the most common genetic causes of HRD (60\% of all CHORD-HRD cases), with RAD51C and PALB2 inactivation resulting in BRCA2-type HRD. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found to be the main inactivating mechanism in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer, whereas for prostate cancer deep deletions (primarily of BRCA2) are also a major cause. From the remaining 40\% of CHORD-HRD patients, 35\% had a monoallelic mutation in one of the HRD associated genes, suggesting that the second allele could be inactivated by epigenetic or regulatory mechanisms. For only 5\% of CHORD-HRD patients, no mutations were identified that could explain the HRD phenotype. Taken together, our results demonstrate that broad genomics-based HRD testing is valuable for cancer diagnostics and could be used for patient stratification towards treatment with e.g. poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).},

  abstract = {Anticancer immunotherapies involving the use of immune-c heckpoint inhibitors or adoptive cellular transfer have emerged as new therapeutic pillars within oncology. These treatments function by overcoming or relieving tumour-induced immunosuppression, thereby enabling immune-m ediated tumour clearance. While often more effective and better tolerated than traditional and targeted therapies, many patients have innate or acquired resistance to immunotherapies. Cancer immunoediting is the process whereby the immune system can both constrain and promote tumour development, which proceeds through three phases termed elimination, equilibrium and escape. Throughout these phases, tumour immunogenicity is edited, and immunosuppressive mechanisms that enable disease progression are acquired. The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy seem to broadly overlap with those used by cancers as they undergo immunoediting to evade detection by the immune system. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we discuss how a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cancer immunoediting process can provide insight into the development of resistance to immunotherapies and the strategies that can be used to overcome such resistance.},

  abstract = {Background: We performed profiling of the immune microenvironment of castrationresistant (CRPC) and castration-sensitive (CSPC) prostate cancer (PC) in order to identify novel targets for immunotherapy. Methods: PD-L1 and CD3/CD8 immunohistochemistry, PD-L1/2 fluorescent in situ hybridization, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and RNA-seq of 395 immune-related genes were performed in 19 CRPC and CSPC. Targeted genomic sequencing and fusion analysis were performed in 17 of these specimens. Results: CD276, PVR, and NECTIN2 were highly expressed in PC. Comparison of CRPC versus CSPC and primary versus metastatic tissue revealed the differential expression of immunostimulatory, immunosuppressive, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Unsupervised clustering of differentially expressed genes yielded two final clusters best segregated by CRPC and CSPC status. Conclusion: CD276 and the alternative checkpoint inhibition PVR/NECTIN2/CD226/ TIGIT pathway emerged as relevant to PC checkpoint inhibition target development.},

  abstract = {Some cancer therapies damage DNA and cause mutations both in cancer and healthy cells of the patient             1             . These therapy-induced mutations may underlie some of the long-term and late side effects of the treatment, such as mental disabilities, organ toxicities and secondary neoplasms. Currently we ignore the mutation pattern and burden caused by different cancer treatments. Here we identify mutational signatures, or footprints of six widely-used anti-cancer therapies with the study of whole-genomes from more than 3500 metastatic tumors originated in different organs. These include previously known and new mutational signatures generated by platinum-based drugs, and a novel signature of treatment with nucleoside metabolic inhibitors. Exploiting these mutational footprints, we estimate the contribution of different treatments to the mutation burden of tumors and their risk of causing coding and likely driver mutations in the genome. In summary, the mutational footprints identified here open a window to precisely appraise the mutational risk of different cancer therapies to understand their late side effects.},

  abstract = {While mutations affecting protein-coding regions have been examined across many cancers, structural variants at the genome-wide level are still poorly defined. Through integrative deep whole-genome and -transcriptome analysis of 101 castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases (109X tumor/38X normal coverage), we identified structural variants altering critical regulators of tumorigenesis and progression not detectable by exome approaches. Notably, we observed amplification of an intergenic enhancer region 624 kb upstream of the androgen receptor (AR) in 81\% of patients, correlating with increased AR expression. Tandem duplication hotspots also occur near MYC, in lncRNAs associated with post-translational MYC regulation. Classes of structural variations were linked to distinct DNA repair deficiencies, suggesting their etiology, including associations of CDK12 mutation with tandem duplications, TP53 inactivation with inverted rearrangements and chromothripsis, and BRCA2 inactivation with deletions. Together, these observations provide a comprehensive view of how structural variations affect critical regulators in metastatic prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Immune cells infiltrating tumors can have important impact on tumor progression and response to therapy. We present an efficient algorithm to simultaneously estimate the fraction of cancer and immune cell types from bulk tumor gene expression data. Our method integrates novel gene expression profiles from each major non-malignant cell type found in tumors, renormalization based on cell-type-specific mRNA content, and the ability to consider uncharacterized and possibly highly variable cell types. Feasibility is demonstrated by validation with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of human melanoma and colorectal tumor specimens. Altogether, our work not only improves accuracy but also broadens the scope of absolute cell fraction predictions from tumor gene expression data, and provides a unique novel experimental benchmark for immunogenomics analyses in cancer research (http://epic.gfellerlab.org).           ,              Malignant tumors do not only contain cancer cells. Normal cells from the body also infiltrate tumors. These often include a variety of immune cells that can help detect and kill cancer cells. Many evidences suggest that the proportion of different immune cell types in a tumor can affect tumor growth and which treatments are effective.             Researchers often study tumors by measuring the expression of genes, i.e., which genes are active in tumors. However, the proportion of different cell types in the tumor is often not measured for tumors studied at the gene expression level.             Racle et al. have now demonstrated that a new computer-based tool can accurately detect all the main cell types in a tumor directly from the expression of genes in this tumor. The tool is called “Estimating the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells” – or EPIC for short. It compares the level of expression of genes in a tumor with a library of the gene expression profiles from specific cell types that can be found in tumors and uses this information to predict how many of each type of cell are present. Experimental measurements of several human tumors confirmed that EPIC’s predictions are accurate.             EPIC is freely available online. Since the active genes in tumors from many patients have already been documented together with clinical data, researchers could use EPIC to investigate whether the cell types in a tumor affect how harmful it is or how well a particular treatment works on it. In the future, this information could help to identify the best treatment for a particular patient and may reveal new genes that cause malignant tumors to develop and grow.},

  abstract = {Background: Investigating genome evolution in response to therapy is difficult in human tissue samples. To address this challenge, we develop an unbiased wholegenome plasma DNA sequencing approach that concurrently measures genomic copy number and exome mutations from archival cryostored plasma samples. This approach is applied to study longitudinal blood plasma samples from prostate cancer patients, where longitudinal tissue biopsies from the bone and other metastatic sites have been challenging to collect. Results: A molecular characterization of archival plasma DNA from 233 patients and genomic profiling of 101 patients identifies clinical correlations of aneuploid plasma DNA profiles with poor survival, increased plasma DNA concentrations, and lower plasma DNA size distributions. Deep-exome sequencing and genomic copy number profiling are performed on 23 patients, including 9 patients with matched metastatic tissues and 12 patients with serial plasma samples. These data show a high concordance in genomic alterations between the plasma DNA and metastatic tissue samples, suggesting the plasma DNA is highly representative of the tissue alterations. Longitudinal sequencing of 12 patients with 2–5 serial plasma samples reveals clonal dynamics and genome evolution in response to hormonal and chemotherapy. By performing an integrated evolutionary analysis, minor subclones are identified in 9 patients that expanded in response to therapy and harbored mutations associated with resistance. Conclusions: This study provides an unbiased evolutionary approach to noninvasively delineate clonal dynamics and identify clones with mutations associated with resistance in prostate cancer.},

We explored four quality metrics, including analysis of dissimilarity to the non-mutated proteome that was predictive of peptide immunogenicity. In patient tumors, neoantigens with high dissimilarity were unique, enriched for hydrophobic sequences, and correlated with survival after PD-1 checkpoint therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer independent of predicted MHC affinity. We incorporated our neoantigen quality analysis methodology into an open-source tool, antigen.garnish, to predict immunogenic peptides from bulk computationally predicted neoantigens for which the immunogenic ‘‘hit rate’’ is currently low.},

  abstract = {Purpose Treatment of advanced non–small-cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is characterized by durable responses and improved survival in a subset of patients. Clinically available tools to optimize use of ICIs and understand the molecular determinants of response are needed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine, but its role in identifying predictors of response to ICIs is not known. Methods Detailed clinical annotation and response data were collected for patients with advanced non–smallcell lung cancer treated with anti–programmed death-1 or anti–programmed death-ligand 1 [antiprogrammed cell death (PD)-1] therapy and profiled by targeted NGS (MSK-IMPACT; n = 240). Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as partial response/stable disease that lasted . 6 months. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), fraction of copy number–altered genome, and gene alterations were compared among patients with DCB and no durable benefit (NDB). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 49 patients to compare quantification of TMB by targeted NGS versus WES. Results Estimates of TMB by targeted NGS correlated well with WES (r = 0.86; P , .001). TMB was greater in patients with DCB than with NDB (P = .006). DCB was more common, and progression-free survival was longer in patients at increasing thresholds above versus below the 50th percentile of TMB (38.6\% v 25.1\%; P , .001; hazard ratio, 1.38; P = .024). The fraction of copy number–altered genome was highest in those with NDB. Variants in EGFR and STK11 associated with a lack of benefit. TMB and PD-L1 expression were independent variables, and a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 further enriched for benefit to ICIs. Conclusion Targeted NGS accurately estimates TMB and elevated TMB further improved likelihood of benefit to ICIs. TMB did not correlate with PD-L1 expression; both variables had similar predictive capacity. The incorporation of both TMB and PD-L1 expression into multivariable predictive models should result in greater predictive power.},

To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non–small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti–PD-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity.

We show here that throughout cancer genomes APOBEC mutagenesis is pervasive and correlates with APOBEC mRNA levels. Mutation clusters in whole-genome and exome datasets conformed to stringent criteria indicative of an APOBEC mutation pattern. Applying these criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 exomes of 14 cancer types, mostly from TCGA, revealed significant presence of the APOBEC mutation pattern in bladder, cervical, breast, head and neck and lung cancers, reaching 68\% of all mutations in some samples. Within breast cancer, the HER2E subtype was clearly enriched with tumors displaying the APOBEC mutation pattern, suggesting this type of mutagenesis is functionally linked with cancer development. The APOBEC mutation pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes, implying that ubiquitous APOBEC mutagenesis is carcinogenic.},

  abstract = {How the genomic landscape of a tumor shapes and is shaped by anti-tumor immunity has not been systematically explored. Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/ 15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity.},

These signatures have been identified from high throughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimization techniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high dimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an important question consists in the determination of the actual number of signatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures from high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.},

  abstract = {The discovery of cancer-associated alterations has primarily focused on genetic variants. Nonetheless, altered epigenomes contribute to deregulate transcription and promote oncogenic pathways. Here, we designed an algorithmic approach (RESET) to identify aberrant DNA methylation and associated cis-transcriptional changes across {$>$}6,000 human tumors. Tumors exhibiting mutations of chromatin remodeling factors and Wnt signaling displayed DNA methylation instability, characterized by numerous hyper- and hypo-methylated loci. Most silenced and enhanced genes coalesced in specific pathways including apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell metabolism. Cancer-germline antigens (CG) were frequently epigenomically enhanced and their expression correlated with response to anti-PD-1, but not anti-CTLA4, in skin melanoma. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of our approach to explore DNA methylation changes in pediatric tumors, which frequently lack genetic drivers and exhibit epigenomic modifications. Our results provide a pan-cancer map of aberrant DNA methylation to inform functional and therapeutic studies.},

  abstract = {Beyond sample curation and basic pathologic characterization, the digitized H\&E-stained images of TCGA samples remain underutilized. To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H\&E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is primarily a linear dimensionality reduction technique that factorizes a nonnegative data matrix into two smaller nonnegative matrices: one that represents the basis of the new subspace and the second that holds the coefficients of all the data points in that new space. In principle, the nonnegativity constraint forces the representation to be sparse and parts based. Instead of extracting holistic features from the data, real parts are extracted that should be significantly easier to interpret and analyze. The size of the new subspace selects how many features will be extracted from the data. An effective choice should minimize the noise while extracting the key features. We propose a mechanism for selecting the subspace size by using a minimum description length technique. We demonstrate that our technique provides plausible estimates for real data as well as accurately predicting the known size of synthetic data. We provide an implementation of our code in a Matlab format.},

  abstract = {Undifferentiated sarcomas (USARCs) of adults are diverse, rare, and aggressive soft tissue cancers. Recent sequencing efforts have confirmed that USARCs exhibit one of the highest burdens of structural aberrations across human cancer. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular basis of the structural complexity in USARCs by integrating DNA sequencing, ploidy analysis, gene expression, and methylation profiling. We identified whole genome duplication as a prevalent and pernicious force in USARC tumorigenesis. Using mathematical deconvolution strategies to unravel the complex copy-number profiles and mutational timing models we infer distinct evolutionary pathways of these rare cancers. In addition, 15\% of tumors exhibited raised mutational burdens that correlated with gene expression signatures of immune infiltration, and good prognosis.},

  abstract = {Cancer is driven by somatically acquired point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, conventionally thought to accumulate gradually over time. Using next-generation sequencing, we characterize a phenomenon, which we term chromothripsis, whereby tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements occur in a one-off cellular crisis. Rearrangements involving one or a few chromosomes crisscross back and forth across involved regions, generating frequent oscillations between two copy number states. These genomic hallmarks are highly improbable if rearrangements accumulate over time and instead imply that nearly all occur during a single cellular catastrophe. The stamp of chromothripsis can be seen in at least 2\%–3\% of all cancers, across many subtypes, and is present in  25\% of bone cancers. We find that one, or indeed more than one, cancer-causing lesion can emerge out of the genomic crisis. This phenomenon has important implications for the origins of genomic remodeling and temporal emergence of cancer.},

  abstract = {Aneuploidy, defined as chromosome gains and losses, is a hallmark of cancer. However, compared with other tumor types, extensive aneuploidy is relatively rare in prostate cancer. Thus, whether numerical chromosome aberrations dictate disease progression in prostate cancer patients is not known. Here, we report the development of a method based on whole-transcriptome profiling that allowed us to identify chromosome-arm gains and losses in 333 primary prostate tumors. In two independent cohorts (               n               = 404) followed prospectively for metastases and prostate cancer-specific death for a median of 15 years, increasing extent of tumor aneuploidy as predicted from the tumor transcriptome was strongly associated with higher risk of lethal disease. The 23\% of patients whose tumors had five or more predicted chromosome-arm alterations had 5.3 times higher odds of lethal cancer (95\% confidence interval, 2.2 to 13.1) than those with the same Gleason score and no predicted aneuploidy. Aneuploidy was associated with lethality even among men with high-risk Gleason score 8-to-10 tumors. These results point to a key role of aneuploidy in driving aggressive disease in primary prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the estimation of the latent dimensionality in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the  -divergence. The  -divergence is a family of cost functions that includes the squared euclidean distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Itakura-Saito (IS) divergences as special cases. Learning the model order is important as it is necessary to strike the right balance between data fidelity and overfitting. We propose a Bayesian model based on automatic relevance determination (ARD) in which the columns of the dictionary matrix and the rows of the activation matrix are tied together through a common scale parameter in their prior. A family of majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms is proposed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. A subset of scale parameters is driven to a small lower bound in the course of inference, with the effect of pruning the corresponding spurious components. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithms by performing extensive experiments on synthetic data, the swimmer dataset, a music decomposition example, and a stock price prediction task.},

  abstract = {Annotation of prostate cancer genomes provides a foundation for discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Concordant assessment of DNA copy number, mRNA expression, and focused exon resequencing in 218 prostate cancer tumors identified the nuclear receptor coactivator NCOA2 as an oncogene in \$11\% of tumors. Additionally, the androgen-driven TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was associated with a previously unrecognized, prostate-specific deletion at chromosome 3p14 that implicates FOXP1, RYBP, and SHQ1 as potential cooperative tumor suppressors. DNA copy-number data from primary tumors revealed that copy-number alterations robustly define clusters of low- and high-risk disease beyond that achieved by Gleason score. The genomic and clinical outcome data from these patients are now made available as a public resource.},

  abstract = {Mutational signature analysis is an essential part of the cancer genome analysis toolkit. Conventionally, mutational signature analysis extracts patterns of different mutation types across many cancer genomes. Here we present TensorSignatures, an algorithm to learn mutational signatures jointly across all variant categories and their genomic context. The analysis of 2,778 primary and 3,824 metastatic cancer genomes of the PCAWG consortium and the HMF cohort shows that practically all signatures operate dynamically in response to various genomic and epigenomic states. The analysis pins differential spectra of UV mutagenesis found in active and inactive chromatin to global genome nucleotide excision repair. TensorSignatures accurately characterises transcription-associated mutagenesis, which is detected in 7 different cancer types. The analysis also unmasks replication- and double strand break repair-driven APOBEC mutagenesis, which manifests with differential numbers and length of mutation clusters indicating a differential processivity of the two triggers. As a fourth example, TensorSignatures detects a signature of somatic hypermutation generating highly clustered variants around the transcription start sites of active genes in lymphoid leukaemia, distinct from a more general and less clustered signature of Polη-driven translesion synthesis found in a broad range of cancer types.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells can acquire profound alterations to the structure of their genomes, including rearrangements that fuse distant DNA breakpoints. We analyze the distribution of somatic rearrangements across the cancer genome, using whole-genome sequencing data from 2,693 tumor-normal pairs. We observe substantial variation in the density of rearrangement breakpoints, with enrichment in open chromatin and sites with high densities of repetitive elements. After accounting for these patterns, we identify significantly recurrent breakpoints (SRBs) at 52 loci, including novel SRBs near BRD4 and AKR1C3. Taking into account both loci fused by a rearrangement, we observe different signatures resembling either single breaks followed by strand invasion or two separate breaks that become joined. Accounting for these signatures, we identify 90 pairs of loci that are significantly recurrently juxtaposed (SRJs). SRJs are primarily tumor-type specific and tend to involve genes with tissue-specific expression. SRJs were frequently associated with disruption of topology-associated domains, juxtaposition of enhancer elements, and increased expression of neighboring genes. Lastly, we find that the power to detect SRJs decreases for short rearrangements, and that reliable detection of all driver SRJs will require whole-genome sequencing data from an order of magnitude more cancer samples than currently available.},

  abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is known to carry heavy mutation load. Besides smoking, cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B plays a key role in the mutation process of NSCLC. APOBEC3B is also reported to be upregulated and predicts bad prognosis in NSCLC. However, targeting APOBEC3B high NSCLC is still a big challenge. Here we show that APOBEC3B upregulation is significantly associated with immune gene expression, and APOBEC3B expression positively correlates with known immunotherapy response biomarkers, including: PD-L1 expression and T-cell infiltration in NSCLC. Importantly, APOBEC mutational signature is specifically enriched in NSCLC patients with durable clinical benefit after immunotherapy and APOBEC mutation count can be better than total mutation in predicting immunotherapy response. In together, this work provides evidence that APOBEC3B upregulation and APOBEC mutation count can be used as novel predictive markers in guiding NSCLC checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy-number profiles at the cellular level. We propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy-number estimation method for the noisy scDNA-seq data. SCOPE’s main features include the following: (1) a Poisson latent factor model for normalization, which borrows information across cells and regions to estimate bias, using in silico identified negative control cells; (2) an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the normalization step, which accounts for the aberrant copy-number changes and allows direct ploidy estimation without the need for post hoc adjustment; and (3) a cross-sample segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells with the same genetic background. We evaluate SCOPE on a diverse set of scDNA-seq data in cancer genomics and show that SCOPE offers accurate copy-number estimates and successfully reconstructs subclonal structure. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

  abstract = {Precision oncology uses genomic evidence to match patients with treatment but often fails to identify all patients who may respond. The transcriptome of these ‘‘hidden responders’’ may reveal responsive molecular states. We describe and evaluate a machine-learning approach to classify aberrant pathway activity in tumors, which may aid in hidden responder identification. The algorithm integrates RNA-seq, copy number, and mutations from 33 different cancer types across The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCanAtlas project to predict aberrant molecular states in tumors. Applied to the Ras pathway, the method detects Ras activation across cancer types and identifies phenocopying variants. The model, trained on human tumors, can predict response to MEK inhibitors in wild-type Ras cell lines. We also present data that suggest that multiple hits in the Ras pathway confer increased Ras activity. The transcriptome is underused in precision oncology and, combined with machine learning, can aid in the identification of hidden responders.},

Using sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms, unbiased catalogs of SVs are emerging from thousands of human cancer genomes for the first time. Via careful examination of SV breakpoints at single-nucleotide resolution as well as local DNA copy number changes, diverse patterns of genomic rearrangements are being revealed. These “SV signatures” provide deep insight into the mutational processes that have shaped genome changes in human somatic cells. This review summarizes the characteristics of recently identified complex SVs, including chromothripsis, chromoplexy, microhomology-mediated breakage-induced replication (MMBIR), and others, to provide a holistic snapshot of the current knowledge on genomic rearrangements in somatic cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently copy number variation (CNV) has gained considerable interest as a type of genomic/genetic variation that plays an important role in disease susceptibility. Advances in sequencing technology have created an opportunity for detecting CNVs more accurately. Recently whole exome sequencing (WES) has become primary strategy for sequencing patient samples and study their genomics aberrations. However, compared to whole genome sequencing, WES introduces more biases and noise that make CNV detection very challenging. Additionally, tumors’ complexity makes the detection of cancer specific CNVs even more difficult. Although many CNV detection tools have been developed since introducing NGS data, there are few tools for somatic CNV detection for WES data in cancer. Results: In this study, we evaluated the performance of the most recent and commonly used CNV detection tools for WES data in cancer to address their limitations and provide guidelines for developing new ones. We focused on the tools that have been designed or have the ability to detect cancer somatic aberrations. We compared the performance of the tools in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) using real data and simulated data. Comparative analysis of the results of the tools showed that there is a low consensus among the tools in calling CNVs. Using real data, tools show moderate sensitivity (\textasciitilde 50\% - \textasciitilde 80\%), fair specificity (\textasciitilde 70\% - \textasciitilde 94\%) and poor FDRs (\textasciitilde 27\% - \textasciitilde 60\%). Also, using simulated data we observed that increasing the coverage more than 10× in exonic regions does not improve the detection power of the tools significantly. Conclusions: The limited performance of the current CNV detection tools for WES data in cancer indicates the need for developing more efficient and precise CNV detection methods. Due to the complexity of tumors and high level of noise and biases in WES data, employing advanced novel segmentation, normalization and de-noising techniques that are designed specifically for cancer data is necessary. Also, CNV detection development suffers from the lack of a gold standard for performance evaluation. Finally, developing tools with user-friendly user interfaces and visualization features can enhance CNV studies for a broader range of users.},

  abstract = {Background: The epigenetic regulation of immune response has been demonstrated in recent studies. Nonetheless, potential roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in tumor microenvironment (TME) cell infiltration remain unknown. Methods: We comprehensively evaluated the m6A modification patterns of 1938 gastric cancer samples based on 21 m6A regulators, and systematically correlated these modification patterns with TME cell-infiltrating characteristics. The m6Ascore was constructed to quantify m6A modification patterns of individual tumors using principal component analysis algorithms. Results: Three distinct m6A modification patterns were determined. The TME cell-infiltrating characteristics under these three patterns were highly consistent with the three immune phenotypes of tumors including immuneexcluded, immune-inflamed and immune-desert phenotypes. We demonstrated the evaluation of m6A modification patterns within individual tumors could predict stages of tumor inflammation, subtypes, TME stromal activity, genetic variation, and patient prognosis. Low m6Ascore, characterized by increased mutation burden and activation of immunity, indicated an inflamed TME phenotype, with 69.4\% 5-year survival. Activation of stroma and lack of effective immune infiltration were observed in the high m6Ascore subtype, indicating a non-inflamed and immuneexclusion TME phenotype, with poorer survival. Low m6Ascore was also linked to increased neoantigen load and enhanced response to anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy. Two immunotherapy cohorts confirmed patients with lower m6Ascore demonstrated significant therapeutic advantages and clinical benefits. Conclusions: This work revealed the m6A modification played a nonnegligible role in formation of TME diversity and complexity. Evaluating the m6A modification pattern of individual tumor will contribute to enhancing our cognition of TME infiltration characterization and guiding more effective immunotherapy strategies.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for defining cellular diversity in tumors, but its application toward dissecting mechanisms underlying immune-modulating therapies is scarce. We performed scRNA-seq analyses on immune and stromal populations from colorectal cancer patients, identifying specific macrophage and conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets as key mediators of cellular cross-talk in the tumor microenvironment. Defining comparable myeloid populations in mouse tumors enabled characterization of their response to myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. Treatment with anti-CSF1R preferentially depleted macrophages with an inflammatory signature but spared macrophage populations that in mouse and human expresses pro-angiogenic/tumorigenic genes. Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40+ Th1-like cells and CD8+ memory T cells. Our comprehensive analysis of key myeloid subsets in human and mouse identifies critical cellular interactions regulating tumor immunity and defines mechanisms underlying myeloid-targeted immunotherapies currently undergoing clinical testing.},
